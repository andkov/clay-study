## Notes on Ancient Portraiture

For most ancient historians, no authenticated portraits survive. The "portraits" often used are:
- Roman copies of lost Greek originals (Herodotus, Thucydides)
- Generic period-appropriate busts
- Renaissance and later imagined portraits
- Medieval manuscript illuminations

When sourcing images, prioritize:
1. Museum-authenticated ancient busts (even if identification is uncertain)
2. High-quality historical reconstructions by reputable sources
3. Period-appropriate generic depictions
4. Renaissance/early modern engravings from historical works
