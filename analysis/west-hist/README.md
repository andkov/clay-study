# Western Historiography

This folder contains a comprehensive reading guide through the evolution of Western historiography, from Herodotus and Thucydides to Ibn Khaldun.

## Main Documents

- **western-historiography-reading-guide.md** - A structured, thematic reading guide through the foundational texts of Western historical thought
- **historian-biographies.md** - Biographical guide with life details, portraits, and timeline visualization for all historians featured in the reading guide

## Overview

The reading guide traces the intellectual conversation that began with the twin foundations of historical inquiry:

- **Herodotus** - Ethnographic curiosity and narrative breadth
- **Thucydides** - Analytical realpolitik and structural causation

From these two poles, the guide follows the evolution of historiographical method through ancient and medieval historians who either continued, reacted to, or synthesized their approaches.

## Approach

The guide is organized around:

1. A core reading sequence with detailed annotations
2. Thematic categorization of historians by methodological archetype
3. Analysis of how each historian relates to the Herodotean and Thucydidean traditions
4. Recommendations for modern translations and editions
5. Guidance on how to approach these texts as an ongoing intellectual conversation

This is a historiographical syllabus designed for students, scholars, and independent readers seeking to understand not just what ancient historians wrote, but *how* they constructed historical knowledge.
