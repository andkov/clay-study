I am an aspiring master-potter undertaking a project to replicate a teapot that I saw in a painting. The teapot in the painting has a swollen, ribbed, pumpkin-like body, a tall and sculptural spout, and a domed lid with a pronounced knob. It is bold, colorful, and expressive — more sculptural than delicate — and I want to translate that painted form into a functional ceramic vessel.

Here is what you need to know about me and my goals:
	•	My technical ceiling for throwing is cylinders up to 1800 g of clay; I want to make this teapot as large as I can within that comfort zone.
	•	I intend to throw the teapot in three main components: body, lid, and spout.
	•	I will give you technical specifications (e.g., clay weights, intended volumes, throwing techniques I am comfortable with), and I expect you to help me refine them.
	•	My challenge is not only to capture the silhouette from the painting but also to solve the functional aspects: lid fit, pouring, balance, and trimming.
